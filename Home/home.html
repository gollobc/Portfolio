        <p>I was born in Hawaii, but have lived in Washington for the majority of my life. I enjoy physical activities like exercise, rock climbing, and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. I have a dog and her name is Pua Nani, which means beautiful flower in Hawaiian. My previous job experience includes playing with molten glass (glassblowing) and climbing off tall buildings (rope access technician).</p>
